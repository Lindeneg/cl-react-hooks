### useBrowserCache

Hook for caching data in `localStorage`. The usage is the same as [useMemoryCache](https://github.com/lindeneg/cl-react-hooks/tree/master/packages/memory-cache) except that `config.data` cannot be specified, as the initial state will be the data found in `localStorage`.

### Installation

`yarn add @lindeneg/browser-cache`
